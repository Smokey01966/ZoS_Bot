# ZoS_Bot
Discord bot for management of online gaming guild. Built in 2018 first attempt at JS.

Managed guild member information, calendars, votes, and polls

Built this by myself over a few months, to help move away from large spreadsheet that held guild information to a database that could allow for automation, clean and orderly inputs and allow entry directly from discord

Fist time coding a large JS project and was largely bodged together in a learn as I went, just make it work not pretty method

Ran for 2 years before it was retired due to simplification of guild management process no longer requiring the bot
